RU translate and support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3241445760]Liberate Country As Subject[/url]

Save game compatible!

Adds an event that fires after you successfully enforce a Liberate Country war goal, allowing you to choose whether they shall remain free or become a subject type of your choosing, with an appropriate infamy cost.

Also makes these released countries inherit your laws, not the laws of the country they were forcibly released from.

AI will always choose the independence option. I might change this if there’s demand for it.
