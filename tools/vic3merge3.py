"""
vic3merge3.py -- three-way merge for Victoria 3 script records.

Why this exists: TGR and VC both rebuild the same vanilla records. Doing the merge
by eye means re-reading a 1000-line interest group per record and re-doing it on
every update of either mod. Vanilla is the common ancestor of both, so the merge
is a plain three-way: take every hunk that only one side touched, and fall back
to a declared winner where both touched the same lines.

Conflicts are NOT silently resolved -- merge3() returns them, and the callers in
regen_vc_tgr.py print every one. A conflict that is not read is a lost edit.

Line granularity, not token: the mods edit whole lines (a value plus a trailing
"#TGR CHANGES" comment), so a finer diff would only produce noise.
