# BPM + E&F ComPatch — technology compatibility
# Goal: ensure E&F finance tech hooks survive when BPM is loaded after E&F.
#
# Primary conflict:
# - Both mods do `REPLACE:currency_standards` (BPM tweaks era/modifiers; E&F uses it to auto-activate fiat law + finance progression).
# - With load order E&F -> BPM, BPM would overwrite E&F and E&F's monetary system breaks.
#
# This patch re-applies E&F's `currency_standards` definition after BPM.
